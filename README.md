# COVID-19 Data Analysis in Asia (2020-2022)

This repository contains an analysis of COVID-19 data in the Asia region (excluding China) for the years 2020 to 2022. The analysis includes insights into the top affected countries, key performance indicators (KPIs), and possible reasons for surges in COVID-19 cases. 

## Top 5 Affected Countries

The top 5 affected countries with the most number of COVID-19 cases in the Asia region during the specified period are:

1. India (44.6 million cases)
2. Japan
3. South Korea
4. Turkey
5. Vietnam

India bears more than half of the total COVID-19 deaths in the Asia region.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Total Cases: 189.6 million
- Total Deaths: 1.48 million
- Total Discharged: 188.2 million
- Total Fully Vaccinated: 627.8 billion

## Waves of COVID-19

For India, the analysis shows that the first wave occurred in the 3rd quarter of 2020, with the highest surge in September. The second wave hit in the 2nd quarter of 2021, peaking in May, and the third wave arrived in the 1st quarter of 2022, with the highest surge in January. In Vietnam, COVID-19 cases reached their peak around March 2022.

## Surge Patterns

Interestingly, the data reveals certain patterns of surges:

- South Korea and Vietnam experienced surges in the 1st quarter (March), while Japan and South Korea saw cases rise at the end of the 3rd quarter (August) in 2022.
- Towards the end of the 4th quarter (December) in 2022, cases in Japan and South Korea surged again.

## Possible Reasons for Surges

The surge in COVID-19 cases in these countries cannot be attributed to a single factor. Possible reasons include:

1. **Stringency Index**: Stringency Index values were low in Japan and South Korea (<50%), but India and Vietnam, with better scores, also had high case numbers.

2. **Cardiovascular Deaths**: High cardiovascular deaths per lakh in 2017 in countries like India, Indonesia, and Iran could have contributed to COVID-19 deaths.

3. **Handwashing Facilities**: Despite good handwashing facilities in some countries, they experienced surges. Conversely, countries with poor facilities also saw surges.

4. **Diabetes Prevalence**: High diabetes prevalence in some countries did not necessarily correlate with surges.

5. **Hospital Beds**: Countries with more hospital beds per 1000 people were better equipped to manage cases.

6. **Older Population**: A higher percentage of older people may have contributed to surges in Japan and South Korea.

7. **Smoking**: While smoking rates were higher in some countries, it did not appear to be the sole reason for surges or deaths.

This analysis provides insights into the complex factors contributing to the COVID-19 situation in the Asia region during the specified period.
